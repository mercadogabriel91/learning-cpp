/*
 *   1. Write a program that consists of a while-loop that (each time around the
 * loop) reads in two ints and then prints them. Exit the program when a
 * terminating '|' is entered.
 *  ------
 *   2. Change the program to write out the smaller value is: followed by the
 * smaller of the numbers and the larger value is: followed by the larger value.
 * ------
 *   3. Augment the program so that it writes the line the numbers are equal
 * (only) if they are equal.
 * ------
 *   4. Change the program so that it uses doubles instead of ints.
 * ------
 *   5. Change the program so that it writes out the numbers are almost equal
 * after writing out which is the larger and the smaller if the two numbers
 * differ by less than 1.0/100.
 * ------
 *  6. Now change the body of the loop so that it reads just one double each
 * time around. Define two variables to keep track of which is the smallest and
 * which is the largest value you have seen so far. Each time through the loop
 * write out the value entered. If itâ€™s the smallest so far, write the smallest
 * so far after the number. If it is the largest so far, write the largest so
 * far after the number.
