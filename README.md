This repository contains my personal C++ code and exercises as I follow along with the book:

## 📚 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I go through the chapters and practice the examples and exercises from the book. I'm uploading my progress here to:

- Track what I've learned
- Keep my code organized
- Share my learning journey publicly

## 📂 Structure

Each folder corresponds to a chapter or topic in the book, with exercises and code snippets inside.  
The structure is meant to follow the book closely, so each section is named accordingly. (more or less)
